The `UPDATE` statement is used to edit existing records in a table. First you will need to provide the table name, then use the `SET` clause to assign the values to the columns you wish to update.

You will likely need to add a `WHERE` clause to your statement to specify which records to update. If `WHERE` is not included then the `UPDATE` will apply to all records in the table.

Example UPDATE statement:
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2...., columnN = valueN
WHERE [condition];
```

Let's see an example of updating an email address for a customer.

```sql
-- UPDATE statement to change an customer
UPDATE  public.customer
SET email = 'juliasmith@gmail.com'
WHERE customer_id = 67;
```
