# Vehicle Transactions

Write transactions to handle the following scenarios:

1. Adding 5 brand new 2021 Honda CR-Vs to the inventory. They have I4 engines and are classified as a Crossover SUV or CUV. All of them have beige interiors but the exterior colors are Lilac, Dark Red, Lime, Navy and Sand. The floor price is $21,755 and the MSR price is $18,999.  

1. For the CX-5s and CX-9s in the inventory that have not been sold, change the year of the car to 2021 since we will be updating our stock of Mazdas. For all other unsold Mazdas, update the year to 2020. The newer Mazdas all have red and black interiors.

1. The vehicle with VIN `YV4852CT5B1628541` has been brought in for servicing. Document that the service department did a tire change, windshield wiper fluid refill and an oil change.
